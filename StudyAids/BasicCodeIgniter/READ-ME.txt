The attached files are the files we modified or created during the session.
You can just copy and paste them into your application folder.

Just to go over the steps you need to follow when you start a new project:
1) Download and unzip CodeIgniter.
2) Point your WAMP/MAMP to your new CodeIgniter directory.
3) Copy the .htaccess file that we provide into the root of that directory.
4) Go to application/config/routes.php Change the line
	$route['default_controller'] = "welcome";
	to
	$route['default_controller'] = "main";
	(Or whatever you named your controller that needs to direct the user to the index page.
	So for example, if you have a controller named user.php that sends you to the index page, you would put $route['default_controller'] = "user";)
5) Ok! now go to application/config/config.php
	We need to set an encryption key. So find the line
	$config['encryption_key'] = ''
	and smash your keyboard for a few seconds. The result should look something like:
	$config['encryption_key'] = 'lginsbey5o8t7abcy4r8atwelidfnugsboibactugvisbylt7qca2y5byrnz8wn4y5ao873b5yfoc8at'; (At least 32 characters!)
6) Now go to application/config/autoload.php
	This is where we select the libraries and helpers that we want to use throughout our application.
	So we want:
	$autoload['libraries'] = array('session', 'database');
	and
	$autoload['helper'] = array('url');

	It's possible that you're going to need more libraries or helpers. You can just add them to the array like this:

	$autoload['libraries'] = array('session', 'database', 'another_library', 'another_another_library');
	$autoload['helper'] = array('url', 'another_helper');

7)Now we go to application/config/database.php
	$db['default']['hostname'] = 'localhost';
	$db['default']['username'] = 'root'; //this should be your username, usually root unless you changed it.
	$db['default']['password'] = ''; //i don't have a password. your password if you're on a mac is probably root, or black if you're on a pc.
	$db['default']['database'] = 'world'; //this is your database name. i'm using the world database from the green belt exam as an example.

	Now we're done with the config folder!

For your Models, Controllers, and Views; I like building them bottom up. So first:

10)Go to application/models. Create a new model file. You don't have to actually put anything here yet except:
	<?php if ( ! defined('BASEPATH')) exit('No direct script access allowed');

	class Name_of_my_model extends CI_Model //replace Name_of_my_model with your model name.
	{
		
	}

8)Go to application/controllers. Create a new controller file. (Such as main.php or user.php).
	We want access to the model we just created, so we need to load it.
	So we define our constructor function:
	function __construct()
	{
		parent:: __construct();
		$this->load->model('Name_of_my_model');
	}
	This means that now we can use the functions in our model file in our controller file!
	(Here's the syntax:
		$this->Name_of_my_model->name_of_the_function_in_my_model();
	)
	Also create an index function in that controller that will tell CodeIgniter which page to display when you go to localhost.

9)Go to application/views. Create the index page to display. (This is the page you were just referring to in your controller.)

That's all it takes to get you started. Take a look at the files included, and join the session this afternoon for more!
Enjoy!
